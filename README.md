# Galaxy-Shooter-Stuff
I made this some time ago as a study for my Udemy's unity course, adapting the lines of code and some of the course's game features to my way of thinking and coding

The game was made with Unity 2018, that is the only prerequisite to run the repository.
None of the art and audio belongs to me and the game is under the General Public License v3.0.
Feel free to use the lines of code as study cases if you like.
